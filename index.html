  <!--change once finished-->              <p>I am an avid rock climber who is 
      trying to find a balance between my work life and my cons <br>
      tant pursuit of higher climbing. I have worked all kinds of jobs
       in all kinds of places. Most recently I was working as a project m
       anager at a small construction company. Loved who I worked for, but the 
       job itself was a bit of the same thing every day and I needed a bit more
        of a challenge.</p>
